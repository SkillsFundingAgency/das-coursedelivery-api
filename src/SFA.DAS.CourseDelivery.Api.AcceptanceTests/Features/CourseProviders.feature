Feature: CourseProviders
	As a CourseDelivery API consumer
    I want to retrieve Providers for a specific Course
    So that I can use them in my own application
#
#Scenario: Get Course Providers
#	Given I have an http client
#    When I GET the following url: /api/courses/10/providers
#    Then an http status code of 200 is returned
#    And  course providers are returned
